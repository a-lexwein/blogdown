      <description>How to easily populate a SQL table using R Here’s a dumb little problem I’ve had to solve a few times while job searching:
Certain roles will want to assess candidates’ ability to write basic SQL queries, but rather than give you access to a SQL database, you’ll merely be provided the schema of the table (the schema tells you the name of all the columns in the tables and the data type for each column), or possibly data in a CSV file or spreadsheet (most recently for me, it was a table within a Word doc).</description>

      <description>Blogging Again Welcome to my new blog. I&amp;rsquo;m not completely sure how I&amp;rsquo;ll use the space, but I&amp;rsquo;m currently job searching. So I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to trick you into think I&amp;rsquo;d make an excellent addition to your data or software team. It will be fun though.
Big thanks to Alison Presmanes Hill for her great blog post on how to get started using Yihui Xie&amp;rsquo;s great blogdown package.</description>
